In this notebook, Iâ€™ll be constructing and analyzing an equal-weighted portfolio which will constitute a list of my favorite large-cap tech stocks that I had already screened using various metrics like debt to asset ratio, investor yield, and other metrics
Then I will use a basic process to find the optimal weighting of the stocks using monte Carlo simulation which I will then compare against certain benchmarks and the equal-weighted portfolio and pick the best one out of the lot
